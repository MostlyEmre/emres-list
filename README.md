# Intro

This is a global list of hotels with good-enough Wi-Fi and decent-enough location. Stayed and verified by me.

## Criteria

- **Good-enough Wi-Fi:** You can conduct your work and meetings without issues.
- **Decent-enough location:** It is either in a self-sufficient location or has convenient public transport access.
- **Relatively good value:** The price is competitive with the top-notch Airbnbs in the area or even better. Maximum $3500 CAD per month. Mostly around $2000-$2500 CAD I found.
- **Confirmed by me:** I stayed in the hotel for at least 2 weeks and successfuly worked from there.
- **Confirmed by you:** You stayed in the hotel for at least 2 weeks and successfuly worked from there. Share speedtest results, the month and price.

The prices can fluctuate, Asia is usually cheap but for the rest, I usually travel during off-seasons to get better prices.

### Little about me to understand the list better:

I am a frontend developer who works global-remote based on EST 9am-5pm from a 13" laptop. I travel with a 14L backpack and stay in hotels for ~1 month at a time. As you can tell from my backpack, I'm a minimalist and don't mind small rooms as long as they are efficiently designed. I don't cook. I don't drive. I'm a total city person who loves walkability in a location. Because of my small backpack, convenient access to non-hotel laundry services is key. Because of the hours I work, co-working spaces are either unavailable or inconvenient, so I would rather work from my hotel room or nearby cafes/lounges.

### Why this list?

No matter how much I pay and research, I always got burned by Airbnbs. I realized, if a hotel has good Wi-Fi and a decent location and a compatitive price with the top-notch Airbnbs, I'm willing to pick the hotel 100% of the time. Majority of the hotels don't put much effort into their Wi-Fi speeds, when you ask you get the answer "we don't know the speed but it's good". So, I decided to create this list to help others like me. (I'm not affiliated with any of the hotels listed here.)

Because this list is an after-thought, I did not save the speedtest results for all hotels. I will start doing that from now on. I will also add more hotels as I travel more.

# The List

## North America

### Canada

#### Quebec City

##### Hôtel AtypiQ

Efficiently designed space similar to Japanese business hotels. It has everything you need in the rooms with good wifi. The location is super walkable and there's a close-by self-service laundry.

## East Asia

### Japan

#### Tokyo

##### APA Hotel Ueno Hirokoji

Classic Japanese business hotel. Small room but has everything you need. Convenient location near Ueno station and Akihabara. Has close-by convenience stores that are open 24/7. Cleaning schedule is around 9AM-1PM Tokyo time. (Can be annoying if you work late and sleep in.) The cleaning crew also drops fresh towels, coffee etc. everyday even if you don't use them. So after a while these start to pile up and you look like a hoarder. I'm sure they would stop giving you new stuff if you tell them. I didn't. Walking distance self-service laundry available, super easy to use, fully digital process.

## South East Asia

### Malaysia

#### Kuala Lumpur

##### WOLO Kuala Lumpur

This hotel saved my life. I was in a bad (pests) but expensive Airbnb (in that 1 famous building with the infinity pool where digital nomads take photos) and I had to move out during my lunch break, had to find a place to stay during my lunch break (late at night in Kuala Lumpur). This hotel has convenient cleaning hours, good wifi, a fancy Starbucks downstairs. The location is right at the center of the city centre. Super walkable, super close to public transportation. There are also affordable laundry services around.

### Philippines

#### Makati

##### City Garden GRAND Hotel Makati

Bonkers city views on higher-floors and on the rooftop. Great Wi-Fi. Close to 24/7 convenience stores and affordable laundry services. Hotel staff is super kind and helpful, they even upgraded my room to a corner suite due to a miscommunication caused by trip.com. I got to sleep on the largest bed I've ever seen. There's a super-close mid-sized shopping mall with movie theatre and restaurants.

### Thailand

#### Bangkok

##### ibis Styles Bangkok Sukhumvit 4

Great Wi-Fi. 24/7 lively location. Many laundry places available around the hotel with super affordable prices. Close to BTS. The only downside is the room doesn't have a chair but a stool with no back support. Maybe the management would provide a chair if you ask. I didn't.

#### Pattaya

##### Mercure Pattaya Ocean Resort

The location of this hotel is a bit far from the center so prepare to walk. It has a Terminal21 shopping mall 10-minute walking distance but you have to cross the street which can be tricky as you have to jaywalk. The hotel is full of amenities and decent internet speeds yet on the lower side of the speed spectrum. This hotel's customer demographics are families with kids as it has a small waterpark. So it can be hectic sometimes. The room has a nice desk and a decent chair. I feel like the ibis Styles Bangkok Sukhumvit 4 was way better than this hotel in terms of cleanliness and location even though it's official star rating is 1 star lower. I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights and the price was 80 CAD for 1 night which is more than fair for a 4-star hotel. Overall, I don't recommend this hotel because of the location and the customer demographics.

# Other hotels that don't fit the criteria

## East Asia

### Hong Kong

#### AKI Hotel Hong Kong - MGallery Collection

This was an interesting hotel, even though it is a 5-star hotel, it doesn't feel like it in terms of amenities, lobby and the rooms. The rooms have a vibe, and their design is highly opinionated. The outlets don't have converters so don't forget to bring your international adapter. The internet speed was decent around 70mbit but there were no tables, just a small surface that you can move around your bed. It is close to MRT, maybe a 5 minutes walk. There's a 7-11 nearby. I would say this hotel is not suitable for working from, but if you're on vacation, it's a good place to stay. I only stayed for 2 nights, and the price was around $260 CAD per night, on the pricey side.
