## Introduction

### About This Guide

This is a carefully curated list of hotels with reliable WiFi and strategic locations, personally verified through extended stays. After repeatedly getting burned by Airbnbs despite thorough research and premium prices, I realized that hotels with good WiFi, decent locations, and competitive pricing are the more reliable choice for digital nomads. Since most hotels don't provide specific information about their WiFi speeds, I created this guide to help others like me find dependable accommodations for remote work.

### About Me

I'm a frontend developer working remotely on EST (9AM-5PM) from a 13" laptop. My approach to travel is minimalist—I carry a 14L backpack and typically stay in one location for about a month. Due to my work hours, co-working spaces are often either unavailable or impractical, so I primarily work from my hotel room or nearby cafes.

Key preferences:

- No cooking required
- No driving - rely on public transport
- Urban environments with high walkability
- Access to laundry services (essential due to minimal packing)
- Efficiently designed spaces (small rooms are fine if well-planned)

### Selection Criteria

- **WiFi Quality**: Consistently reliable for video calls and development work
- **Location**: Either self-contained with amenities or well-connected by public transport
- **Value**: Competitive with or better than premium Airbnbs (Maximum: 3500 CAD/month, typically 2000-2500 CAD)
- **Verification**: Personal stay of at least two weeks with successful remote work experience
- **Community Verification**: Welcome from others who have stayed minimum 2 weeks (include speedtest results, month, and price)

_Note: Prices vary by season. Most favorable rates in Asia, while other regions are best visited during off-peak periods. Future entries will include speedtest results._
